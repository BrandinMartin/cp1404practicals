# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

50%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I would ideally watch the lecture videos on Monday since Tuesday is reserved for another subject and Wednesday would not
give me enough time to process the information. My primary study location is my desk in my room since that is where my 
PC is located which at times isn't ideal since it is easy to get distracted when you don't have a designated area for
study.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think that attending the PASS class is helpful since it is a bit of an interactive experience that can be helpful 
alongside the seminar. Also I believe that I am slowly obtaining more of a grasp on the fundamentals of programming and 
I am slowly starting to feel a bit more comfortable.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to make sure that I start watching all of the lecture videos instead of leaving the material learning for later 
on in the week which gives me less time to digest before applying it to my practical work.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

On top of watching the lecture videos, starting to work on my practicals even a day or 2 before would help improve
the quality of my work and will help me memorise the content more effectively. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am cross-referencing my practical work with both past work from myself and also the lecture videos, as well as the 
solutions on occasions to help ensure that I am going in the right direction and not spending time doing the incorrect
things.
